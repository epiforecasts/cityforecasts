This document describes the analysis plan to perform both a real-time and retrospective evaluation of the models submitted to the [`flu-metrocast Hub`](https://github.com/reichlab/flu-metrocast) for the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season.
The `flu-metrocast` Hub was developed in order to address a request for more local-level forecasting efforts in the United States.
It serves as a platform for assessing the robustness and accuracy of local-level forecasts, which can in return facilitate improved methods to address the nuances and complexities that arise when working with local level data at small population sizes.
To assess the forecast performance of the localized forecasts in the Hub, we will use both the forecasts in the GitHub repository representing the real-time submissions as well as retrospectively produced forecasts from each of the 4 submitting teams for true and approximated historical snapshots of the data available as of each forecast date for the boroughs of New York City and a selected subset of HSA regions in Texas. Additionally, teams will retrospectively generate aggregate-level forecasts using their model fit only to the aggregate data (either all of New York City combined or all of Texas).
The population-scaled aggregate-level forecasts will be used to represent the "status quo" in absence of local level forecasting, with the implicit assumption being that in absence of local forecasting in presence of a more aggregate forecast, the aggregate-level forecasts dynamics would likely be imposed upon the locality of interest.

## Aims
The goal of these analyses will be to assess:
1. How do local level forecasts compare to aggregate level forecasts in terms of forecast performance across different models?
2. Which models performed best in the local setting in real-time and retrospectively accounting for confounding variables in epidemic phase and data availability?
